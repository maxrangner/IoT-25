# IoT-25:02 - C/C++ Uppgift 1

## Premise
An IoT system often collects sensor readings, for example temperature, moisture levels and pressure. To understand these readings we need to analyze them.

## Assignment
Develop a C/C++ program that process a list of measurements. Your code has to have a GitHub repo, and your work and solution has to be documented in the repo README.


## Features
- `Statistic calculations`
    - Basic statistics: Sum, mean, min, max.
    - Advanced statistics: Variance, standard deviation.
- `Data management`
    - Add values manually.
    - Simulate values by randomizer.
- `Menu system`
    - Menu selection by numbers.
    - Input validation function.


## Usage
1. **Add new values**: Adds new values, one at a time. Enter "done" when done. 
2. **Display statistics**: 
3. **Display graph**: 
4. **Display values sorted**:
5. **Find value**: 
6. **Simulate values**: 
7. **Quit**: 

## Technical Details
- Struct object to store temperature value and time stamp.
- Structs are added to vector.
